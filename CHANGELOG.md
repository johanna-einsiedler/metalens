# Changelog

All notable changes to the engine. Versions are git tags (`vX.Y.Z`); the same version is
published to PyPI as `maseminer` and deployed as the hosted Metalens / MASEMiner service.

## Unreleased

- One engine, two product surfaces: the brand (Metalens or MASEMiner) is chosen per request
  from the hostname (`paperlens/brands.py`, `GET /api/brand`), with its own landing page,
  page chrome and preset list (`meta.brands` on presets).
- Single-user local mode: `maseminer` starts the engine on one machine with an embedded
  PostgreSQL (`pgserver`), no accounts, no Redis, extractions inline; data in `~/.maseminer`.
- Logged-out retention: uploads of anonymous sessions are deleted after two idle hours
  (`paperlens/retention.py`); a durable free-trial counter and a per-network daily cap.
- Import page: re-importing a paper into its dataset replaces the old copy; datasets can
  remove duplicate papers; the citable dataset download can be re-imported.
- Review: empty cells are editable; identical highlight rectangles are painted once; a
  click on a number lands on the citation that contains it.
- Declarative preset format (format 2) with generated evidence / confidence sections,
  content-addressed schema ids, saved setups, the human–AI collaboration preset.
- Exports carry the engine version and commit and, per paper, the prompt hash, resolved
  model, parameters and extraction time.

## 0.1.0 — first tagged release

- Initial public version.
