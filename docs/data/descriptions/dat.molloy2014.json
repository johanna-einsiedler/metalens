  "details": [
    "Conscientiousness, one of the big-5 personality traits, can bedefined as “socially prescribed impulse control that facilitates task- and goal-directed behaviour, such as thinking before acting, delaying gratification, following norms and rules and planning, organising and prioritising tasks” (John & Srivastava, 1999). Conscientiousness has been shown to be related to a number of health-related behaviors (e.g., tobacco/alcohol/drug use, diet andactivity patterns, risky behaviors). A recent meta-analysis by Molloy et al. (2014) examined to what extent conscientiousness is related to medication adherence, that is, the extent to which (typically chronically ill) patients follow a prescribed medication regimen (e.g., taking a daily dose of a cholesterol lowering drug in patients with high LDL serum cholesterol levels). The results from the 16 studies included in this meta-analysis are provided in this dataset."
