The outcome measure for this meta-analysiswas the standardized mean difference (with positive valuesindicating a higher mean level of academic achievement in theintervention group).The standardized mean differences given here are bias-correctedand therefore differ slightly from the values reported in thearticle. Also, since only the total sample size is given in thearticle, the sampling variances were computed under the assumptionthat n_i1 = n_i2 = n_i / 2."],"concepts":["education"," standardized mean differences"," meta-regression"],"note":[""],"source":["Bangert-Drowns, R.
