Since studies differed in the way recidivism wasdefined and assessed, results are given in terms of standardizedmean differences, with positive values indicating a higherprevalence of recidivism in the group of juveniles with a mentalhealth disorder.Multiple effect size estimates could be extracted from moststudies (e.g., for different delinquent behaviors in whichjuveniles could have recidivated), necessitating the use ofappropriate models/methods for the analysis. Assink and Wibbelink(2016) illustrate the use of multilevel meta-analysis models forthis purpose."],"concepts":["psychology"," criminology"," standardized mean differences"," multilevelmodels"," cluster-robust inference"],"note":["The ‘year’ variable is not constant within study 3, as this studyrefers to two different publications using the same data."],"source":["Assink, M., & Wibbelink, C.
